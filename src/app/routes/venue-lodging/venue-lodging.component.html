          MaryBud Farms was established in 2015 by Morgan’s parents, Mark and Maril MacDonald, to preserve the legacy of a place for
          family and friends to gather. It's named in memory of Morgan’s grandparents, "Bud" and Mary Gagen.

          <br><br> The property is about creating a community around what’s possible and where we’re going, rooted in the
          core values of key people in our lives. This makes "the farm" a natural destination for us to start our lives together,
          surrounded by the community that has played an integral part of who we are.
